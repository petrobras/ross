ROSS is a Python library for rotordynamic analysis, which allows the construction of rotor models and their numerical
simulation. Shaft elements are modeled with the Timoshenko beam theory, which considers shear and rotary inertia
effects, and discretized by means of the Finite Element Method. Disks are assumed to be rigid bodies, thus their strain
energy is not taken into account. Bearings and seals are included as linear stiffness and damping coefficients.

After defining the elements for the model, you can plot the rotor geometry and run simulations such as static analysis,
modal analysis, undamped critical speed, frequency response, unbalance response, time response, and more.

You can try it out now by running the tutorial on [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/petrobras/ross/1.4.0?filepath=%2Fdocs%2Ftutorials)

# Contributing to ROSS
ROSS is a community-driven project. If you want to contribute to the project, please
check [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/petrobras/ross/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

The code has been initially developed by Petrobras in cooperation with the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)
with contributions from the Federal University from Uberl√¢ndia (UFU).
Currently, Petrobras has a cooperation agreement with UFRJ (LAVI) and UFU (LMEST) to develop and maintain the code.
