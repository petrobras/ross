The following enhancements and bug fixes were implemented
for this release:

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements for plotting results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This PR make some modifications in results.py


* Add show(camp) to show campbell bokeh plotting
* Add command to allign ColorBar axis for better looking
* Add figure dimensions for campbell bokeh plotting
* increases the font size of all axis labels 

Some bokeh figures have the attribute ``sizing_mode="stretch_both``.  This command line is used so that the plotting of the graphics is always the maximum size of the browse. However, this creates a bug in jupyter notebook, and the graphs does not appears. So it should be replaced  by ``width`` and ``height`` command lines


* adds an interpolation function to highlight to the user the intersection between the critical frequency curves and the speed line


Index method
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adds ``.dof_local_index()`` and ``.dof_global_index()`` methods to the elements.
These methods will return namedtuples with the index for each coordinate based on the following convention:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18506378/60285143-abde9500-98e3-11e9-83a2-fdbe401d6034.png
   :target: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18506378/60285143-abde9500-98e3-11e9-83a2-fdbe401d6034.png
   :alt: image


As an example:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import ross as rs
   >>> from ross.materials import steel

   >>> le = 0.25
   >>> i_d = 0
   >>> o_d = 0.05
   >>> sh_el = rs.ShaftElement(le, i_d, o_d, steel, n=2)
   >>> sh_el.dof_local_coordinates()
   LocalIndex(x0=0, y0=1, alpha0=2, beta0=3, x1=4, y1=5, alpha1=6, beta1=7)
   >>> sh_el.dof_global_coordinates()
   GlobalIndex(x0=8, y0=9, alpha0=10, beta0=11, x1=12, y1=13, alpha1=14, beta1=15)

With this we can change the following code:

.. code-block:: python

           for elm in self.shaft_elements:
               n1, n2 = self._dofs(elm)
               M0[n1:n2, n1:n2] += elm.M()
           for elm in self.disk_elements:
               n1, n2 = self._dofs(elm)
               M0[n1:n2, n1:n2] += elm.M()

To:

.. code-block:: python

           for elm in self.elements:
               dofs = elm.dof_global_index()
               n0 = dofs[0]
               n1 = dofs[-1] + 1  # +1 to include this dof in the slice
               M0[n0:n1, n0:n1] += elm.M()


interactions with rotor plotting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When plotting a rotor, the user will be able to check some parameters of the elements in the output image itself, just by moving the cursor over the desired element, for example:

By moving the cursor over a shaft element the user will see this:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45969994/60343963-dc7a0980-998b-11e9-8a06-8073934132cf.png
   :target: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45969994/60343963-dc7a0980-998b-11e9-8a06-8073934132cf.png
   :alt: shaft


And, by moving the cursor over a disk element the user will see this:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45969994/60343980-e7349e80-998b-11e9-9e07-cb72aeea216f.png
   :target: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45969994/60343980-e7349e80-998b-11e9-9e07-cb72aeea216f.png
   :alt: disk


I didn't add the same functionality to bearing elements because the coefficients may vary with rotor speed, and this may cause a misunderstanding to the user.


Move time response plotting to results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Removes the code related to plotting from this file. It was transfered to results.py
* Replaces the method name from plot_time_response to run_time_response.
* Fix ForcedResponseResults docstring 


Add tapered shaft element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Add new element:  tapered shaft element
* Add class ShaftTaperedElement
* This class have, basically, the same inputs than "ShaftElement". The difference relies on entering the diameters of each side of the element (left and right).
* Patches methods were adapted to draw the conical shape of the element.

The matrices generated for this element follow the reference below.

..

   Genta, G., and Gugliotta, A. (1988). A conical element for finite element rotor dynamics, Journal of Sound and Vibration 120,175-182.



Improving plot rotor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This PR modifies the plotting size of disks, bearings and seals. The size, previously based on shaft length, is now calculated based on the shaft diameter. 


Add Check slenderness ratio method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adds a method that will return the colored rotor plot if the condition to the mininum slenderness ratio is not met.

Now using ``.plot.rotor()`` won't display the colored rotor anymore. Instead, the user will call ``.check_slenderness_ratio()`` to check this attribute.


Make Free-Body Diagram more readable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pull Request to fix Issue #243 


* Slightly increases the size of the figures
* Arrows have a fixed length now (as shown in this figure below);
* Arrows now have different colors to distinguish forces (from shaft, disks or bearings/seals);
* Labels were rotated 90ยบ;
* Text font size reduced to "9pt";
* Y axis is hidden. The force values are only displayed only next to the arrows, without size ratio.


Replace bearing plot style / remove element length dependency from glyphs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Bearing representation changes from a simple square to a spring-damper set.
* Fix bug glyphs were plotted on the minimum outer diameters of a shaft node.
* Removes length attribute from ``patch()`` and ``bokeh_patch()`` of BearingElement and DiskElement classes.

Add API_report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Work in Progress

This PR adds some plotting styles follwing the API reference:


* Separation Margin
* Amplification Factor 
* Table of API parameters

It follows the Issue #195 


Add new "Tag" attribute to elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Disk, bearing and seal elements now get an attribute called "Tag".
This allows the user to name the elements to help refer to the actual equipment (impellers, blades, labyrinth seal...)

If the user do not input a tag, it's named after:


* Disk 1, 2, 3... 
* Bearing 1, 2, 3...
* Seal 1, 2, 3...

As bearings and seals are input in the same list of objects, this situation below may happens:

.. code-block::


   def rotor_example():
       i_d = 0
       o_d = 0.05
       n = 6
       L = [0.25 for _ in range(n)]

       shaft_elem = [
           ShaftElement(
               l, i_d, o_d, steel, shear_effects=True, rotary_inertia=True, gyroscopic=True
           )
           for l in L
       ]

       disk0 = DiskElement.from_geometry(
           n=1, material=steel, width=0.07, i_d=0.05, o_d=0.28
       )
       disk1 = DiskElement.from_geometry(
           n=3, material=steel, width=0.07, i_d=0.05, o_d=0.28, tag="disk_test"
       )
       disk2 = DiskElement.from_geometry(
           n=5, material=steel, width=0.07, i_d=0.05, o_d=0.28, tag="disk_test2"
       )

       stfx = 1e8
       stfy = 1e8
       bearing0 = BearingElement(0, kxx=stfx, kyy=stfy, cxx=1000, tag="brg")
       bearing1 = BearingElement(6, kxx=stfx, kyy=stfy, cxx=1000)
       seal0 = SealElement(2, kxx=1e2, kyy=1e2, cxx=500, cyy=500, tag="seal")
       seal1 = SealElement(4, kxx=1e2, kyy=1e2, cxx=500, cyy=500)

       return Rotor(shaft_elem, [disk0, disk1, disk2], [bearing0, seal0, seal1, bearing1])

   >>> rotor = rotor_example()
   >>> rotor.df_bearings["tag"]
   0    brg
   1    seal
   2    Seal 2
   3    Bearing 3
   Name: tag, dtype: object

The counting for bearings and seals is not independent. I don't see it as big deal, but I'm open to suggestions.


Add separated DataFrame to seals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This splits bearings from seals in two different dataframes:


* df_bearings for bearings
* df_seals for seals

It aims to better organize the elements and to avoid code interpretation problems such as in static analysis:

This is the free-body diagram of an example while seals and bearings are merged in same dataframe. The code interprets seals like bearings and calculate reaction forces where both seals are placed:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45969994/64347715-c6f81000-cfca-11e9-83b1-1acc0cb47c90.PNG
   :target: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45969994/64347715-c6f81000-cfca-11e9-83b1-1acc0cb47c90.PNG
   :alt: antigo


And now, spliting bearings and seals:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45969994/64347738-d2e3d200-cfca-11e9-88fb-3e74144f45a4.PNG
   :target: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45969994/64347738-d2e3d200-cfca-11e9-88fb-3e74144f45a4.PNG
   :alt: novo


Also, fix a bug when modeling too flexible bearings, displacement were getting larger than acceptable.
It uses axuliar bearings with high stiffness, considering almost zero displacement in bearing nodes.


Split StaticResults plot method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This commit splits the plot method in four:


* plot_deformation()
* plot free_body_diagram()
* plot_shearing_force()
* plot_bending_moment()
  This is related to Issue #303.


Add BallBearing and RollerBearing Element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This PR adds two new classes:


* BallBearingElement
* RollerBearingElement

These classes create a bearing element for ball and roller bearings models. They are instantiated based os some geometric and constructive parameters like: number of rotating elements, size (diameter for ballbearing; length for rollerbearing) of the rotating elements, contact angle, and static loading force. 

The direct stiffness coefficientes are calculated using these parameters.

I also left an opened option to instantiate the direct damping coefficients. But if it's set as None, they are calculated based on the stiffness coefficient as the literature suggests.
However the cross-coupling coefficients are set to zero, and the coefficients are not dependent on speed.

.. code-block::

       def __init__(
           self,
           n,
           n_balls,
           d_balls,
           fs,
           alpha,
           cxx=None,
           cyy=None,
           tag=None,
       ):

           Kb = 13.0e6
           kyy = (
               Kb * n_balls ** (2./3) * d_balls ** (1./3) *
               fs ** (1./3) * (np.cos(alpha)) ** (5./3)
           )

           nb = [8, 12, 16]
           ratio = [0.46, 0.64, 0.73]
           dict_ratio = dict(zip(nb, ratio))

           if n_balls in dict_ratio.keys():
               kxx = dict_ratio[n_balls] * kyy
           else:
               f = interpolate.interp1d(nb, ratio, kind="quadratic")
               kxx = f(n_balls)

           if cxx is None:
               cxx = 1.25e-5 * kxx
           if cyy is None:
               cyy = 1.25e-5 * kyy

           super().__init__(
               n=n,
               w=None,
               kxx=kxx,
               kxy=0.0,
               kyx=0.0,
               kyy=kyy,
               cxx=cxx,

               cyy=cyy,
               tag=tag,
           )


Add condition to ShaftTaperedElement instantiation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Add a condition if the user do not attribute any value to inner and outer diameters on the right side, the values are automatically set to be equal the left side.
* Also, move the "material" input to the first position, so the geometric parameters can be grouped together.
* Adapt the examples in docstring.
* 
  Moves the inputs from ShaftTaperedElement to match the new position set.

  .. code-block::

     class ShaftTaperedElement(Element):
       def __init__(
           self,
           material,
           L,
           i_d_l,
           o_d_l,
           i_d_r=None,
           o_d_r=None,
           n=None,
           axial_force=0,
           torque=0,
           shear_effects=True,
           rotary_inertia=True,
           gyroscopic=True,
           shear_method_calc="cowper",
           tag=None,
       ):

           if i_d_r is None:
               i_d_r = i_d_l
           if o_d_r is None:
               o_d_r = o_d_l


Patches for PointMass element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As required by issue #310 


Add __repr__, __eq__, and example() to point mass element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This commit adds the following methods to PointMass class:


* **repr** - representative method;
* **eq** - comparasion method;
* point_mass_example() - to run some doctests.


Improvements to Static Analysis Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Related to Issue #327
* Remove force_data dictionary
* Get the items and transform them in Rotor attributes

  * shaft_weight - Shaft total weight
  * disk_forces - Weight forces of each disk
  * bearing_reaction_forces - The static reaction forces on each bearing


General Modifications in CampbellResults
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is related to Issues #326 and #328.


* Introduce a condition to add the hover tool only if an harmonic crosses a critical speed curve.
* Remove some unused imports.
* In _plot_bokeh:

  * Change colormap from viridis to Red-Blue
  * Add diferent colors to harmonics lines
  * Make glyphs on legend with same color

* In _plot_matplotlib:

  * Add diferent colors to harmonics lines

* For both methods:
  Restructure code to increase efficiency (reduce plotting time): I could the plot time in an half by rearranging some routines.

.. code-block::

   import ross as rs
   rotor = rs.rotor_example()
   camp = rotor.run_campbell(np.linspace(0, 1000, 10)).plot([0.25, 0.5, 1, 2])
   show(camp)

I've measured the time just to run the .plot(). It was taking 2.5s for the rotor_example(). Rearranging the code, it has been reduced to 1.2s for this same example.


Add summary table to plot rotor information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Related to Issue #327.

It's a first idea from what the summary will become.
The class get the values stored in dataframes and turns them into a bokeh widget in table format.

We still can build other tables to make it more complete and useful to manipulate data. 


Improvements to SummaryResults
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Related to Issue #327 
Follows the PR #338 


* Add new attribute "tag" to name the rotor;
* Add CG and Moment of Inertia parameters;
* Add new attributes to .summary() method;
* Add a system of Tabs that allows the user to alternate between
  tables;
* Tables are separeted in:

  * Rotor summary
  * Shaft summary
  * Disk summary


Add Stability Level 1 analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* 
  This analysis consider a anticipated cross coupling QA based on conditions at the normal operating point and the cross-coupling required to produce a zero log decrement, Q0.

* 
  Add attribute "rotor_type" 


  * This attribute is necessary to distinguish overhung and between bearings rotors.
  * The unbalance forces and and the respective nodes where they are introduced depends on this information.

* 
  Improve unbalance force method.


  * With this improvement, the unbalance forces are calculated according to the rotor_type and 
    consideres the disks and shaft wheight (if overhung).

* 
  Change mode_shape to find nodes according to rotor_type


  * The method .mode_shapes() was capturing the maximum points from the rotor's mode shapes without checking if it was overhung or between bearings.
  * For rotors where the disk is cantilevered beyond the bearings, unbalance shall be added at the disk. So, the method now checks the rotor_type to define the nodes correctly.

* 
  Add machine_type and disk_nodes attribute 


  * Machine_type will be useful to help the code to distinguish between compressors, turbines, etc. Because each machine type has their own conditions to be calculated.
  * Disk_nodes is useful to collect the disk of interest. if we are working with a overhung rotor, disk_nodes will collect the disk which are overhung only, for example.

This Level 1 analysis does not have the screening criteria yet.
The next step is to implement the Level 2 analysis. Once I get to work on it, I'll add the screening criteria. I still need to organize some ideas for the next step.


Add Bearing Summary Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* add a summary table for bearing elements: for now it displays only where it's placed and the reaction forces.
* fix bug: when setting and disk or bearing element in the last node, the code would fail
* other minor changes


Improvements to api_report.py - Add test_api_report.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Add Stability level 1 screening criteria;
* Modifies the code to storage the cross-coupling range for each rotor stage (or impeller). This is useful to distinguish the cross-coupling evaluation for different ``rotor_types`` (between bearings, overhung...);
* Add ``.summary()`` method;
* Add summary for stability level 1


Add stability analysis level 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the level 2 stability analysis additional sources that contribute to the rotor stability shall be considered. These sources shall replace the cross-coupling Qa, calculated in the stability analysis level 1


Visual improvements to graphs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The labels, ticks and titles font size from bokeh figure were small when putting it presentations. So I've increased the font size of all graphs.


* Add new tab to the ``.summary()`` with stability level 2 data;
* Change stability level 2 labels for better user understanding when using ``.summary()``. The labels include explicitly all the components considered in a certain analysis (Shaft + Bearing + Disk + Seal...);
* Increases labels, titiles and tick font sizes (results.py and api_report.py);
* Add mcs speed to evaluate mode shapes (api_report.py);
* Fix ``.unbalance_response()`` plot size to match results.py file;
* In ``.stability_level_1()`` remove condition from returning and add it as attribute;
* ``.run_modal().plot_mode()`` add legend informing the whirl direction.


Add method to plot orbit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* 
  Add ``.run_orbit_response()`` method to rotor_assembly.py.


  * ``.run_orbit_response()`` calculates the orbit for a rotor's given node, speed and forces.

* 
  Add class ``OrbitResponseResults`` to results.py.


  * Class used to store results and provide plots for orbit response.

Example using this new method:

.. code-block::

   >>> rotor = rotor_example()
   >>> speed = 500.0                                           # pick a rotor speed
   >>> size = 10000                                            # time array's size
   >>> node = 3                                                # node of interest
   >>> t = np.linspace(0, 10, size)                            # create time array
   >>> F = np.zeros((size, rotor.ndof))                        # create force vectors
   >>> F[:, 4 * node] = 10 * np.cos(2 * t)                     # introduce a periodic force in a single dof
   >>> F[:, 4 * node + 1] = 10 * np.sin(2 * t)                 # introduce a periodic force in a single dof
   >>> response = rotor.run_orbit_response(speed, F, t, node)  # run orbit response
   >>> show(response.plot())                                   # plot orbit response


3D plots for orbit response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Related to PR #385.


API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 Fix Campbell's strange behavior for precession 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Fix equality for bearing element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes the equality for bearing element, allowing the comparison with
objects from different types, e.g. bearing == 1 will return False,
before an AttributeError was raised since int doesn't have .\ **dict**.
This also removes pytest as a dependence for the user.


Add import to Axes3d
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The import has been added to the results module because the mode shape
plot needs this to work. Although it looks like the import is not being
used (this is highlighted by linters), matplotlib, for some strange
reason, actually needs this to use the projection='3d'.
A doctest has been added to the mode shape plot for the tests to fail
if this import is removed.


Fix bearing type definition and add new test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix the bearing type definition and also add a new test that checks if a second analytical way to calculate the pressure matrix matches the numerical way.
Close #175 


Improvements for plotting results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This PR make some modifications in results.py


* Add show(camp) to show campbell bokeh plotting
* Add command to allign ColorBar axis for better looking
* Add figure dimensions for campbell bokeh plotting
* increases the font size of all axis labels 

Some bokeh figures have the attribute ``sizing_mode="stretch_both``.  This command line is used so that the plotting of the graphics is always the maximum size of the browse. However, this creates a bug in jupyter notebook, and the graphs does not appears. So it should be replaced  by ``width`` and ``height`` command lines


* adds an interpolation function to highlight to the user the intersection between the critical frequency curves and the speed line


Fix bug - plotting unbalance response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unbalance response was not plotting when calling it using matplotlib


Make Free-Body Diagram more readable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pull Request to fix Issue #243 


* Slightly increases the size of the figures
* Arrows have a fixed length now (as shown in this figure below);
* Arrows now have different colors to distinguish forces (from shaft, disks or bearings/seals);
* Labels were rotated 90ยบ;
* Text font size reduced to "9pt";
* Y axis is hidden. The force values are only displayed only next to the arrows, without size ratio.


 Fix inconsistencies in the mass and gyroscopic matrices; New tests for shaft tapered element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I found some problems in shaft tapered element matrices. Fow now I've fixed the issues on mass and gyroscopic matrices. Besides this PR modifies the tests for this class, adding tests to compare two cylindrical elements built from ``ShaftElement`` and ``ShaftTaperedElement`` classes. However, tests for stiffness matrices are skipped.


Fix typo in __repr__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It follows the Issue #255. 


Fix inconsistencies in the stiffness matrix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Fix some typos in geometry coefficients;
* Fix stiffness matrix formula for shaft tapered elements;
* Fix docstrings for M(), K(), G() in ShaftTaperedElement;
* Add better docstrings to ShaftTaperedElement.

Fix tests to match the changes done in shaft_element.py:


* Fix stiffness matrix test;
* Fix element attribute tests ;
* Fix comparation tests.


Fixing doctests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Well, since I have forgotten to add the .py extention on api_report file, the CI's were not running the tests on it. And now that I did it, the building is failing due some tests.

This PR tries to fix this problem on api_report.py and in results.py (with new docstrings on ModeShapeResults)

The last PR (#272) was a failure actually.


Adapt convergence analysis to ShaftTaperedElement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now the convergence analysis uses the class ShaftTaperedElement to generate shaft elements since it's more generic.
This should solve issue #280.


Add separated DataFrame to seals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This splits bearings from seals in two different dataframes:


* df_bearings for bearings
* df_seals for seals

It aims to better organize the elements and to avoid code interpretation problems such as in static analysis:

This is the free-body diagram of an example while seals and bearings are merged in same dataframe. The code interprets seals like bearings and calculate reaction forces where both seals are placed:

And now, spliting bearings and seals:

Also, fix a bug when modeling too flexible bearings, displacement were getting larger than acceptable.
It uses axuliar bearings with high stiffness, considering almost zero displacement in bearing nodes.


Fix warning when changing number of nodes to be plotted 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Related to Issue #295 


Remove unit conversion factor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Remove a conversion factor (meters to milimeters) from the plot_deformation() ColumnDataSource.
So the x and y axis units get to be the same.

Related to Issue #312 


Improvements to Static Analysis Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Related to Issue #327
* Remove force_data dictionary
* Get the items and transform them in Rotor attributes

  * shaft_weight - Shaft total weight
  * disk_forces - Weight forces of each disk
  * bearing_reaction_forces - The static reaction forces on each bearing


Fix bearings not connecting to tapered elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Related to Issue #332


Fix bug when plotting bearings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Fix bug when plotting bearing elements in a given node with more than 1 shaft element on it. The bearing would not get correct starting point.
* Fix bug when using scale_factor with point mass. The auxiliar bearing would disattach from the first bearing.


Fix bug in .run_freq_response()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix a bug that happens when calling ``.run_freq_response()`` with default arguments, i.e:

.. code-block::

   >>> rotor = rotor_example()
   >>> response = rotor.run_freq_response()
   Traceback (most recent call last):

     File "<ipython-input-3-292fe59ccc9e>", line 1, in <module>
       response = rotor.run_freq_response()

   AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'imag'

Since running ``.run_modal()`` is required to create the attribute ``evalues``\ , we need to call this function (run_modal()) before creating a default speed_range based on the evalues.

This should fix it.
