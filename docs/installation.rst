Installation
============

.. _introduction:

Install Python
--------------

If you don't have Python installed in your machine, the first thing you should do is install it.

Since ross requires a number of packages to be installed besides
Python, such as numpy, we recommend installing Anaconda 
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ which is a distribution of Python for scientific computing
that aims to simplify package management and deployment. It contains Python and a large number
of packages that are commonly used.
Alternativaly, you may refer to the `Python website
<http://www.python.org/>`_.
Ross's code was tested in Python 3.6 and higher.

Install ross
------------

Using the terminal (or the Anaconda prompt if on Windows) you can install the latest release version with::

    pip install ross-rotordynamics

Alternatively, you can install the development version from github::

    pip install git+https://github.com/ross-rotordynamics/ross.git
