Installation
============

.. _introduction:

Install Python
--------------

The first step is to install Python. Since ROSS requires several packages to be installed besides Python, such as
numpy and scipy and we recommend installing `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ (version 3.6 or higher) which is a
scientific Python distribution that aims to simplify package management and deployment. It contains Python and a large
number of packages that are commonly used.
Alternatively, you may refer to the `Python website
<http://www.python.org/>`_.
ROSS code is tested in Python 3.6 and higher.

Install ROSS
------------

Using the terminal (or the Anaconda prompt if on Windows) you can install the latest release version with::

    pip install ross-rotordynamics

Alternatively, you can install the development version from github::

    pip install git+https://github.com/ross-rotordynamics/ross.git
